# Dependabot Supply Chain Scout

You have 47 unreviewed Dependabot PRs. You're going to merge most of them anyway. So did the maintainers of [XZ Utils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor), [event-stream](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident), and dozens of other projects before a malicious update slipped through.

**This bot gives every dependency PR a real second opinion before it merges.**

**TL;DR — what it checks and why:**
- **Does this version have known vulnerabilities?** Queries [OSV - Open Source Vulnerabilities database](https://osv.dev) (includes the [OpenSSF malicious-packages database](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages)) for CVEs and confirmed malicious packages.
- **Is the package itself suspicious?** [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev) scans for obfuscated code, install-time scripts, typosquatting, and permission creep.
- **What code actually changed?** Downloads and diffs both package archives — flags new binary `.so`/`.dll`/`.node` files (which execute on import), new install hooks, and unusual dependency additions.
- **Is the release fresh?** Releases younger than 24h are flagged as "very fresh"; younger than 7 days as "recent". Auto-merge won't fire on anything under 7 days by default.
- **Did the maintainer change?** A new account publishing a popular package is a classic supply chain attack vector.
- **Was it built from the right place?** Checks [SLSA/Sigstore](https://slsa.dev) attestations — cryptographic proof that the artifact was built by a specific CI pipeline from a specific repo. A mismatch is an automatic red flag.
- **Is the upstream repo healthy?** Queries the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev) to check if the project has dangerous CI workflows, overprivileged tokens, or no active maintenance.
- **Is this a zombie package?** Flags bumps to deprecated packages or patches to old major version lines while a newer major is actively maintained.
- **Is the PR itself suspicious?** Checks that only dependency files changed — finding a Dockerfile or CI workflow script in a "routine dep bump" is a red flag.

It classifies the risk as GREEN / YELLOW / RED, posts a comment explaining its reasoning, and takes action based on how you've configured it (or nothing if you haven't).

> **Status:** Experimental — self-hosted, bring your own keys. Run the worker locally or deploy it yourself (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)). No shared infrastructure, no accounts, no sign-up.

## What it actually does

When a Dependabot or Renovate PR opens on **GitHub or GitLab**, the Scout:

1. **Fetches signals** from public APIs (PyPI/npm/RubyGems, OSV, Socket.dev, pypistats, SLSA provenance) — no API keys required for most signals
2. **Downloads and diffs** the package archive to see what code actually changed
3. **Classifies risk** as GREEN, YELLOW, or RED using your choice of LLM — Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, or a custom plugin — with a rule-based fallback if you'd rather not use any LLM
4. **Posts a verdict comment** to the PR/MR explaining its reasoning
5. **Takes action** based on how you've configured it — or does nothing if you haven't

**RED** means something looks wrong: a new binary `.so`/`.node` file, obfuscated code, a maintainer account that appeared last week, exec/eval on dynamic strings, network calls added to install scripts.

**YELLOW** means "worth a look": major version bump, package released less than 7 days ago, new maintainer, unusually large diff for a patch bump, low download count.

**GREEN** means: patch or minor bump, well-established package, no CVEs, no red flags in the diff, release has been out for at least a week.

### Safe by default

**If you don't configure anything, the Scout only posts comments.** It never merges, closes, or requests review unless you explicitly enable it in `.github/triage-agent.yml`. This means installing it on a repo you haven't thought about yet is harmless.

### What the comment looks like

Every PR gets a comment like this:

---

> **Dependabot Triage Agent — 🟡 YELLOW**
>
> **Confidence:** 75%
>
> > Routine minor bump, but released 18 hours ago — too fresh to auto-merge by default. No CVEs, maintainer stable, diff looks like a docs update.
>
> **Flags:**
> - very fresh release (18h old)
>
> [View workflow run](http://localhost:8233/...) · [Configure triage behavior](.github/triage-agent.yml)

---

For a GREEN verdict, the comment is shorter — just the badge, reasoning, and a link. For RED, all flags are listed in full.

## Try it in 5 minutes

You need Python 3.10+, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporal-community/dependabot-supply-chain-scout
cd dependabot-supply-chain-scout
uv run python setup.py
```

The setup script checks prerequisites, explains the tradeoffs between a PAT and a GitHub App, lets you choose your LLM (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, or skip), writes `.env`, and prints the repo config snippet to paste into your target repo.

Then:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Temporal dev server
temporal server start-dev

# Terminal 2 — worker
uv run python -m worker

# Test a triage run against a real public package (no API keys needed)
uv run python -m start_workflow \
  --repo temporalio/ai-cookbook \
  --package idna \
  --old-version 3.11 \
  --new-version 3.15 \
  --pr-number 122
```

Open **http://localhost:8233** to watch the workflow run in the Temporal UI. No API keys needed — it'll use the rule-based classifier and log what it would do without touching the actual PR.

### What each credential unlocks

| Configured | What changes |
|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Rule-based classifier, log-only output |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude classifies (set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to pin a version) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_MODEL` | OpenAI classifies instead |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` + `OLLAMA_MODEL` | Local Ollama classifies — free, no data leaves your machine |
| `CLASSIFIER=rule_based` | Force rule-based even when an LLM key is present |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` or GitHub App | Posts real PR comments on GitHub |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | Posts real MR comments on GitLab |
| `ENABLE_PR_ACTIONS=true` | Can auto-merge/block PRs if you've configured it |
| `SOCKET_API_KEY` | Adds Socket.dev supply-chain score to signals |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what you have, or run `uv run python setup.py` to be walked through it interactively.

## Configuring your repo

Add `.github/triage-agent.yml` to any repo where you want the Scout to do more than comment. All fields are optional — omitting the file entirely is safe (comment-only mode).

A ready-to-copy template is at [`.github/triage-agent.yml.example`](.github/triage-agent.yml.example).

### Full config reference

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_merge_enabled` | `false` | Enable auto-merge for classified PRs |
| `auto_merge_classifications` | `["green"]` | Which verdicts are eligible for auto-merge |
| `auto_merge_min_confidence` | `0.80` | Classifier confidence required before auto-merge fires (0–1) |
| `min_release_age_hours` | `168` (7 days) | Never auto-merge a release newer than this, even if GREEN |
| `reviewers` | `[]` | GitHub usernames to request review on YELLOW verdicts |
| `block_classifications` | `["red"]` | Close the PR and add a label for these verdicts |
| `max_new_dependencies` | `5` | Flag as YELLOW when a bump adds more than this many new direct deps |
| `extra_signal_activities` | `[]` | Additional Temporal activity names to call (for ecosystem plugins) |

**Minimal "just auto-merge safe stuff" config:**

```yaml
# .github/triage-agent.yml
auto_merge_enabled: true
reviewers: [your-github-username]   # gets pinged on yellow
```

**Stricter config — wait a week, block red, request two reviewers on yellow:**

```yaml
auto_merge_enabled: true
auto_merge_min_confidence: 0.90
min_release_age_hours: 168
reviewers: [alice, bob]
block_classifications: [red]
```

**Observe-only (just get comments, never take action):**

```yaml
# Empty file, or omit the file entirely — this is the default.
block_classifications: []   # override the default red-blocking if you want truly zero action
```

## Extending the Scout

Everything that varies between deployments is pluggable via Python entry points — no forking required.

| What to extend | Entry point group | How |
|---|---|---|
| New package ecosystem | `triage_agent.ecosystems` | Implement `EcosystemProvider`, or use `RemoteEcosystemProvider` for non-Python stacks |
| Custom classifier (OpenAI, Gemini, …) | `triage_agent.classifiers` | Implement `async def classify(signals) -> Verdict`, set `CLASSIFIER=name` |
| Extra signal activities | `triage_agent.activities` | Decorate with `@activity.defn`, list in `extra_signal_activities` config |
| New dependency bot (PyUp, etc.) | call `register_bot_parser()` | Implement `BotParser` with `bot_logins` and `parse()` |

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full examples of each.
